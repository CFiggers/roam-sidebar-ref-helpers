# Sidebar/References Helper Commands

This extension adds five new helper commands to the Roam Command Palette:

- Right Sidebar Collapse (rscolw)
- Right Sidebar Expand (rsexpw)
- Right Sidebar Close (rsclsw)
- Linked References Collapse (refcol)
- Linked References Expand (refexp)

Use them quickly by opening the command palette and then typing the first few letters in the command's abbreviation. Then hit enter once the autosuggest narrows the list down to the command you'd like to use.

## Usage Examples

### Right Sidebar Collapse (rscolw)

TODO: Add a gif here.

### Right Sidebar Expand (rsexpw)

TODO: Add a gif here.a

### Right Sidebar Close (rsclsw)

TODO: Add a gif here.

### Linked References Collapse (refcol)

TODO: Add a gif here.

### Linked References Expand (refexp)

TODO: Add a gif here.

## Prior Art

These commands are based on and follow a similar architecture to the similar commands that are part of Roam 42. There's no need for this extension if you are a Roam 42 user, but if you prefer not to have all of the features bundled with Roam 42, you can use this extension as a lightweight alternative.
